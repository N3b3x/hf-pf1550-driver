Interrupt to indicate a push of the ONKEY button. Goes high after
debounce.
0 — Interrupt cleared or did not occur

whenever ONKEY button is pushed low for longer than the falling
edge debounce setting.
Interrupt also occurs whenever ONKEY button is released high
for longer than the rising edge debounce setting, provided it went
past the falling edge debounce time. In other words, this interrupt
occurs whenever a change in status of the ONKEY_PUSHS
sense bit occurs.

This contains same value as power-up sequence value by

LDO2_PWRDN_SEQ[2:0], LDO3_PWRDN_SEQ[2:0].
VREFDDR_PWRDN_SEQ[2:0]) that sets its power-down
sequence. The default setting of the above registers is equal
to the corresponding power-up sequence setting. For example,
SW1_PWRDN_SEQ[2:0] = OTP_SW1_PWRUP_SEQ[2:0].
When the power-down sequencer is activated, regulators are
turned off one by one in the descending order of the XXX_
PWRDN_SEQ[2:0] setting. This way, by default, power-down
is a mirror of the power-up sequence. In one of the "System
On" states, the processor can change the values of the XXX_
PWRDN_SEQ[2:0] registers. The power-up sequence is fixed by
OTP (or TBB). If all XXX_PWRDN_SEQ[2:0] = 0x00, the powerdown sequencer is bypassed and all the regulators are turned off

Charger sense
0 — Charger is in precharge mode, CHG_OK = 1, VBATT <
VPRECHG.LB, TJ < TSHDN
1 — Charger is in fast-charge constant current mode, CHG_OK =
1, VBATT < VBATREG, TJ < TSHDN
2 — Charger is in fast-charge constant voltage mode, CHG_OK =
1, VBATT = VBATREG, TJ < TSHDN
3 — Charger is in end-of-charge mode, CHG_OK = 1, VBATT ≥
VBATREG, IBAT = IEOC, TJ < TSHDN
4 — Charger is in done mode, CHG_OK = 0, VBATT >
VBATREG-VRESTART, TJ < TSHDN
5 — Reserved
6 — Charger is in timer fault mode, CHG_OK = 0, VBATT <
VBATOV, if BATT_SNS = 0b001 then VBATT < VBATPC, TJ <
TSHDN
7 — Charger is in thermistor suspend mode, CHG_OK =
0, VBATT < VBATOV, if BATT_SNS = 0b001 then VBATT <
VPRECHG.LB, TJ < TSHDN
8 — Charger is off, input invalid and/or charger is disabled,
CHG_OK = 0
9 — Battery overvoltage condition
10 — Charger is off and TJ > TSHDN, CHG_OK = 0
